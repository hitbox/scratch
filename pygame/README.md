# Pygame Examples

## pygamelib.py

Ongoing effort to pack away things I keep making while writing pygame toys.

## blademode.py

Metal Gear Rising blade mode toy.

## inventory.py

Resident Evil 4 like inventory.

## listbox.py

Very simple window with its own "camera" for working out a prototype for making, say, a listbox.

## outline_snake.py

Incomplete snake game to demonstrate drawing the outline of the snake by removing the sides of rects that intersect the center lines between rects.

## rectcut.py

Inspired by: https://halt.software/dead-simple-layouts/

Using a generic resizing function and a cutting function cut a rect, splitting into two for layout purposes.

## Notes

- Keeping everything single files for now.
