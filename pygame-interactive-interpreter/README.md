## pygame-interactive-interpreter

Coming at a personal project to have a Python interactive interpreter available
inside a pygame loop again.

Liking how the lib.Readline stuff is falling together better this time.

Might as well work out composable engine components again.

## run

`python -m demos.helloword`

`python -m demos.readline`

## TODO/WISHLIST

1. readline history
2. text selection
3. random coding challenge generator
   a. set piece challenges combined?
   b. rate of fire against the player's code?
      ii. code an even number check function and throw numbers at it, at some
          rate; increased the rate like an enemy firing at it.
   c. the pieces the player builds can be reused to fight enemies.
