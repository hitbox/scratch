# scratch

Personal projects and interests.

### [`pygame/`](./pygame)

Main reason this repo exists. Wanted to stop making pygame toys from scratch everytime. 

### [`misc`](./misc)

Usually interesting things I find and want to try myself, that don't have a dependency on [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org).

### others

The others are things I might come back to, so I'm keeping them around.
