Tile 20000117 by Joe Wingbermuehle

>Description
This is a game in which you try to put the tiles in order. A tile must be
next to an empty space to be moved. Click the tile to move it.
This game isn't the best, but it's my first attempt at using GTK. So that's
my excuse :P

>Installation
 - Edit the Makefile (if necessary)
 - Run 'make'
 - su root
 - Run 'make install'
This program requires GTK (www.gtk.org).
